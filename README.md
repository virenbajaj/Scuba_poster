# About

This is an unofficial poster template for the Institute for Software Research
at Carnegie Mellon.

[Here's an example of what the emplate looks like.](https://github.com/cyrus-/papers/blob/master/sanitation-psp14/poster/poster.pdf).

# Credits

Nathan Fulton 2014.

The sty for this poster is based upon a theme by David Vilar, which itself was
based on a theme by Rob J Hyndman.

# Todo

It would be nice if the title bars matched the exact color of the logo.
I am no designer.
