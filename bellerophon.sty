%% This package provides tools for writing programs in the Bellerophon proof
%% search programming language for KeYmaera X. In includes:
%%   * Definitions of base combinators and of common tactics in the tactic library.
%%   * Definitions of evaluation relations for the language's formal semantics
%%   * Definitions for disjunctive cost graphs (DCGs) (deprecated)
